React is a Javascript library for building UI.
React is a library not a framework.
React knows only one thing that is to create an awasome UI.


React follows component based approach.
  A component is one of the core building blocks of react.In other words, we can say that every application you will develop in react will be made up of pieces called components.Components make the task of building UIs much easier.
